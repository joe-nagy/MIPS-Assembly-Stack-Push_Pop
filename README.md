# MIPS-Assembly-Stack-Push_Pop
MIPS Assembly code demonstrating Stack Push / Pop

This MIPS assembly code showcases the implementation of stack-based push and pop operations on an integer array. It uses macros to simplify the stack manipulation process and includes printing statements for each action. This code is to demonstrate the practical application of macros in managing data structures within the MIPS assembly language.
